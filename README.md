# Hi, I'm Hudy

I'm a backend Django developer with a passion for building robust web applications. This README provides an overview of my skills and a showcase of a key Django project I've worked on.

## Let's Connect

I'm interested in collaborating with fellow developers, startups, and organizations in need of Django expertise. If you'd like to discuss backend development or Django-related projects, please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:hudaifa00@icloud.com) or connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hudy0000).

Thank you for visiting my profile and exploring my backend Django project. I look forward to connecting and sharing experiences in the world of Django development!
